# Zamboni

Python library for working with PSO2 ICE files, based on [https://github.com/Shadowth117/ZamboniLib](ZamboniLib).

## Installation

This project uses C++ extensions, so a [C++ compiler](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers) is required.

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
pip install .
```

To install in editable mode, so changes you make to the library apply immediately, use this command to install instead:

```sh
pip install . -e
```
